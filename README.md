## Description

Iron Co-Workers helps you improve your portfolio through collaboration with amazing professionals. The user when accessing will be able to search for projects and send requests to try to be a member of the project team. The team lead (responsible for the project) will be able to accept or deny the requests. In this way, a network of professionals who seek to networking and increase their portfolio is created. Both collaborators and team leaders win, improving their background.
